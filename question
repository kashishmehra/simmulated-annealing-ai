Q. Consider the following 2-SAT problem with 4 Boolean variables a, b, c, d:
F=(¬a v d) ^ (c v b) ^  ( ¬c v ¬d)  ^ ( ¬d v ¬b) ^  (¬a v ¬d)
Let the candidate solution be of the order (abcd) and the initial candidate solution be (1111).
use sigmoid function to calculate the probability for moving from current state to next state. 
Sample from uniform distribution to make the decision. Output all the solutions. 
Let heuristic to evaluate each solution be number of clauses satisfied in the formula. 
Apply Simulated Annealing (Consider T= 1000 and cooling function = T-10)
